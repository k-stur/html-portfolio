<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My goal is to obtain a work from home position doing Front End Web Development
  in order to be home to care for my elderly mother. I am a former educator
  looking to change careers after 10 years full time teaching. I am excited to
  transition to web development. I personally enjoy working on projects and
  making new things. I also enjoy taking current projects and making them
  better.

  Hobbies I enjoy include gardening, reading, learning new coding skills, and
  entertaining my numerous pets which include 4 cats and 1 dog.
